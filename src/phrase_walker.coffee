    # phrase walker
    # =============
    # 
    # LATER...
    # 
    # Walkers can enter and exit this phrase tree 
    # at any phrase node.
    # 
    # The mechanics of the walker then exiting will
    # need to be parameterized...    
    # 
    # ...A walker entering at a non-leaf node may sensibly 
    # result in the walker forking, with multiple walkers 
    # departing at each leaf nested within the entry node. 
    # 
    # (or something... %-)
